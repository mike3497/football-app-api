## MyCFBPickem API
An API I created to go along with the [front-end](https://github.com/mike3497/football-app).

The API is created with Express and connects to a MySQL server hosted on AWS. The API was hosted on Heroku until they stopped offering a free tier.

The API also had a route that connected to a free college football data API to grab games for each week during the season. It could then also update the games with the latest scores.
